  <h1>Blog: On Being Other</h1>

  <div class="blog-post-content">
    <p>I read an article the other day about how general acceptance of homosexuality has declined for the first time since the 80s. It feels like just another worrying intimation of the overall social regression going on everywhere you look these days. And yes, I realise that makes me sound like an old man, comparing today with golden yesterdays &ndash; but I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m wrong.</p>
<p>Being bi or gay, or being black, or asian, or an immigrant, or being short, or fat, or even being a woman sometimes&hellip; Whatever it is, it makes you an &ldquo;other&rdquo;. Most of us are &ldquo;other&rdquo; in some way, but some of us are &ldquo;otherer&rdquo; than the rest. And once you reach a certain threshold of otherness, you can start to feel it in the way people treat you. And it fucks you up, whether you realise it or not.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve never participated a lot in civil rights movements. Though as a gay male there&rsquo;s been a certain amount of incidental participation. I&rsquo;ve been to Pride parades, I wear a fabulous rainbow Apple Watch strap, and I don&rsquo;t tune-in to anything written by that hateful Graham Linehan.</p>
<p>The truth is that I&rsquo;ve been lazy &ndash; or maybe intellectually apathetic is more accurate. I&rsquo;ve inherited this convenient skill from my mum where I can just not think about a thing that I don&rsquo;t want to think about. It&rsquo;s a Travis family trait, passed down through the Welsh side for decades. I&rsquo;m a professional elephant ignorer when it suits me.</p>
<p>I came out shortly after I moved to the UK from Canada about eight years ago. When I came out, it mostly wasn&rsquo;t a big deal. A few hiccups here and there but mostly no one really cared. I didn&rsquo;t have skin in the game, I didn&rsquo;t feel the <em>need</em> to fight for what was, at least for me, a non-issue.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m a wealthy white male and I totally get how lucky I am. This accidental luck has enabled me to just <em>not think</em> about this stuff too closely. I&rsquo;ve always been able to appreciate the &ldquo;struggle&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s been at an arms length. Those social injustices you hear about in the news, I&rsquo;d tsk and shake my head, I&rsquo;d sympathise with the people involved, and maybe sometimes I&rsquo;d even put in the effort to empathise a bit as well. But I&rsquo;d activate my Travis superpower and move on to more important things in my life. I&rsquo;m a busy guy and those people aren&rsquo;t me.</p>
<p>With rising radicalism, I&rsquo;ve been more introspective, and the news about declining gay acceptance hit me in a way I didn&rsquo;t expect. Like shit, there are people out there that kinda just hate me for being me. And most of these people have always existed. I wonder how many times I&rsquo;ve been silently hated without even knowing it. That&rsquo;s a bit scary. But even scarier is how our society has regressed to a point where people feel safe expressing those antiquated sentiments &ndash; even if it&rsquo;s only in a poll.</p>
<p>For the first time, I&rsquo;m starting to consciously feel like an &ldquo;other&rdquo;. I was in a pub the other day chatting with a friend over cheap G&amp;Ts, and I swear I could feel the old timer sitting at the next table staring daggers at my rainbow watch strap. I took it off.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re not an other, then it&rsquo;s probably hard to imagine how pervasive otherness really is in our lives. It&rsquo;s everywhere. It&rsquo;s watching what you say, how you act, how you dress. It&rsquo;s holding your tongue. It&rsquo;s being on your guard. It&rsquo;s choosing your battles. I hadn&rsquo;t actually noticed how it affected my own behaviour until I started thinking about it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a matter of degree, too. Gay people today are fortunate to have queer forebearers who battled for the rights we enjoy. What I&rsquo;m realising more and more is how those rights can so easily slip away when people like me become too complacent.</p>
<p>The backward trod where hating gays is back in vogue and xenophobia is patriotic and all the rest &ndash; as an other, it&rsquo;s very troubling. Even if you&rsquo;re not gay, even if you&rsquo;re not a minority, this should scare the shit out of you too. Because even if you aren&rsquo;t an other today, I bet you&rsquo;re <em>just different enough</em> to be one tomorrow.</p>
