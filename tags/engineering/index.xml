      <description>We have a collection of nearly 700 integration tests (and growing!) in over 130 suites that we run against a live MySQL database. These tests are mostly performing GraphQL mutations, and the tests basically just assert that the mutation does what it&amp;rsquo;s meant to do.
As time goes on and we add more and more tests, the test suite was becoming slower and slower&amp;hellip;
Resetting the DB between tests To ensure tests aren&amp;rsquo;t too fragile, early on we added a beforeAll routine that reset the database between each suite.</description>
