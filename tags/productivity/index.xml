      <description>If you&amp;rsquo;re anything like me, you like keyboard shortcuts. I like to set up custom shortcuts and macros to automate everything I can. The problem is that the most convenient keyboard combinations are already in use by the OS or by user applications.
That&amp;rsquo;s where the Hyper Key (also sometimes called a Super Key) comes in. Basically: Get rid of the useless caps-lock key and turn it into a new modifier key that isn&amp;rsquo;t used by anything else.</description>

      <description>There are a few apps on OSX that quit/terminate once their window is closed. This is typical on Windows of course, but it&amp;rsquo;s a bit random on OSX. Some (most?) apps stay open, and some close. I find it really bloody annoying. I&amp;rsquo;ll quit my apps when I&amp;rsquo;m ready to quit them, thank you very much.
The biggest sore spot with me is 1password which I use dozens of times a day, and every time I CMD+W to close the window (muscle memory!</description>
