      <description>Over the years, there have been so many blog posts determined to convince us that Google is becoming evil. This isn&amp;rsquo;t one of those kinds of rants. I don&amp;rsquo;t really mind Google as a company. I love my Nexus 5, I still use Google search and I love Google Chrome. I think they do some pretty stupid stuff from time to time (more on this below), but I don&amp;rsquo;t think they&amp;rsquo;re fundamentally an evil company and my moving away from them isn&amp;rsquo;t some kind of political statement.</description>
